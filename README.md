# CarDealershipApplication
Full stack application with a server and a client

	With this application I will be creating a full stack application of a car dealership. 
This is going to be a website that the car dealership can use to sell their cars. This application will be used by Employees and 
user alike. The only difference is the functionality of the web page. For example, if a user logs in all they can do is view the 
lot, create a application, and view the cars they own. While an employee accepts or reject a application, and add a car to the lot.	
	
	The technologies being used are Spring mvc/data/test, Angular, H2database, Protractor, Selenium. The main focus on this 
project will be the testing aspect of each part. So, for the server it will be the unit tests, while the client will be the web 
base automation. Incorporated a H2database to learn how to use a embedded database instead of a Oracle SQL database.

Technologies
	Spring mvc/data/test/rest, Eclipse, H2Database, Mockito, Junit
	Angular, Protractor, Selenium, Bootstrap, Typescript, html, css
